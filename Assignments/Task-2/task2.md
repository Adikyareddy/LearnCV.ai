### 💻 Tasks to Complete

1. **Image Operations**

   * Load, display, and save images.
   * Access and modify pixel values.
   * Crop, resize, and copy regions of interest (ROI).

2. **Pixel-wise Operations**

   * Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
   * Image blending and masking.
   * Bitwise operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT.
   * Thresholding (binary, adaptive, Otsu).

3. **Drawing & Annotation**

   * Draw shapes: rectangles, lines, circles, ellipses, polygons.
   * Add text with different fonts, sizes, and colors.

4. **Color-space Transformations**

   * Convert between BGR, Grayscale, HSV, and LAB.
   * Extract and manipulate individual color channels.

5. **Geometrical Transformations**

   * Image translation, rotation, scaling, flipping.
   * Affine and perspective transformations.

6. **Video Processing**

   * Load and save video files.
   * Access video properties: frame count, fps, resolution.
   * Capture live video from the webcam.
   * Display live video feed and process frames in real-time.
