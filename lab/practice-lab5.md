# Practice Lab - 5: Image & Video Processing with OpenCV

## 🎯 **Objective:**

To gain hands-on experience with **OpenCV** for **image and video processing**. Students will learn to **load, manipulate, and save images**, perform **geometrical and color-space transformations**, and handle **video streams** using Python.

---

## 💻 OpenCV Tasks

1. **Load, display, and save images** using OpenCV.
2. **Pixel access and manipulation**: read pixel values, modify them.
3. **Copy image and ROI (Region of Interest)**, crop images, and perform **resizing**.
4. **Pixel value operations**:
  * Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
  * Blending two images
  * Bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
  * Thresholding (binary, adaptive)
5. **Drawing on images**:
  * Shapes: rectangle, line, ellipse, circle, polygon
  * Add **text annotations** with custom fonts and colors
6. **Color-space transformations**:
  * BGR ↔ Gray, BGR ↔ HSV, BGR ↔ LAB
  * Extract channels, manipulate individual channels
7. **Image geometrical transformations**:
  * Translation, rotation, scaling, flipping
  * Perspective and affine transforms
8. **Video processing**:
  * Load and save video files
  * Access video properties (frame count, fps, resolution)
  * Open webcam and capture frames
  * Display live video stream with real-time processing
  * Save captured frames or videos

## 🛠️ **Lab Instructions for Students**

* Set up **Python environment** with OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`).
* Load sample images and videos for practice.
* Document your **code snippets**, **observations**, and **results** with screenshots.
* Submit the lab manual with **all implemented tasks** and **output images/videos**.
